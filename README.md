Future work:

* Search by multiple ingredients so user can input what ingredients they have on hand and get a list of recipes they can make.
* Add recipe by pasting in link to online recipe url, which the program then parses to auto-create the recipe.
* Create Django project with the same functionality, but available in web browser with functional UI.
